# IWU-BethelTech.Component-State
This is an example of me creating a main component that returns all of other created components. I created a component that contained a state field with two fields. I then, created two buttons that, upon click, increases the number of enrolled students or waitlisted students by one. 
I created two input fields that each have a button and when a number is entered, the number of enrolled or waitlisted students increase by a specified amount.
I displayed the number of enrolled and waitlisted students on the page by using <b>ReactDOM.render()</b>.
